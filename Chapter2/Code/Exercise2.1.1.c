//  To Determine the ranges of char, short, int and long variables, both signed and unsigned, by printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating-point types
// The ANSI Standard for C specifies that ranges be defined in <limits.h>. The ranges may vary from machine to machine.

#include<stdio.h>
// determine ranges of types
 int main()
{
    
    //signed types

    printf("Signed char max = %d\n", (char)((unsigned char) ~0 >> 1));
    printf("Signed short min = %d\n", ~(short)((unsigned short)~0>>1));
    printf("Signed short max = %d\n", (short)((unsigned short) ~0 >> 1));
